# MindScape

Mindscape is an innovative application designed to address the mental health issues by providing an easy-to-use, affordable, and supportive application to help users manage their depression. By integrating AI technology and psychology, we offer effective features for education and depression management.

## Key Features

1. **GABI**: An AI-powered chatbot trained with data from a psychologist, designed to provide quick service, create a comfortable user experience, and be available 24/7. Users can engage in dialogue with GABI as if conversing with a real psychologist, ensuring anonymity and reducing the stigma of discussing personal issues.

2. **QuietZone**: A feature that serves as a sanctuary for reducing stress levels. According to medical information from Mayo Clinic ("Meditation: A simple, fast way to reduce stress"), meditation can be an alternative to clearing the mind from the many causes of stress. QuietZone combines meditation with Virtual Reality (VR) to provide an immersive meditation experience in tranquil and natural environments. Users can choose from various settings without the need to physically travel, saving time and effort.

## Our Solution

## About Flutter

Flutter is an open-source UI software development kit created by Google. It allows developers to build applications for multiple platforms (Android, iOS, Web, and Desktop) from a single codebase using the Dart programming language. We chose Flutter for this project because it offers rapid development, a rich set of widgets, and a reactive framework that facilitates building high-performance, visually attractive, and natively compiled applications.
